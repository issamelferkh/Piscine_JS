## Basic rules

* The Node.JS version used by JS Piscine is LTS 14.x.
* The questions are arranged in ascending order of difficulty.
* Your code will be peer-reviewed, so please make it **easy for others to read**! (For example, naming variables meaningfully or naming functions according to their functions.)
* For the problem of implementing a function, the function is imported through the module upon evaluation. Therefore, you need to export the function code to be submitted.
  - If there is only one function to be implemented, `default export` must be processed.
* Modules related to development such as **nodemon** and **ESlint** must be defined in `devdependencies`.
* Before proceeding with the evaluation, install all the prerequisite modules through the `npm install` command.
* Unnecessary files like `node_modules` should be properly excluded via `.gitignore`.
* We do not evaluate the code format, but it is recommended to proceed while checking the code format through eslint or beautify.
* **RTFM!!**
* Subjects can be changed up to 1 hour before the submission deadline.
* If you find an error (a typo or logical error) in the issue, please register the issue in the [github repository](https://github.com/issamelferkh/Piscine_JS). Your help makes JS Piscine more perfect :)
